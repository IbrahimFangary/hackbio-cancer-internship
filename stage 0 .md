**Transcriptomics in the discovery of cancer-related biomarker** 

Author: Ibrahim Fangary

Transcriptomics is the study of all of RNA transcripts inside the cell which allows for the large-scale quantification of gene expression under many conditions. It plays a vital role in biomarker discovery, particularly in cancer research. Biomarkers are defined as biological molecules related to pathological or normal processes in cancer. Through transcriptomics, identifying overexpressed or suppressed genes can provide valuable insights into potential cancer biomarkers (1).  
Early diagnosis of cancer can help in prevention and treatment; by comparing transcriptomics from diseased and healthy patients, researchers can understand cancer heterogeneity and identify biomarkers that differentiate the cancerous cells, and distinguish between subtypes of cancer. Biomarkers can also offer prognostic insights by predicting of disease progression or patient state (2).

Transcriptomics analysis can provide insights into future clinical aspects, such as disease recurrence, mortality following treatment, or outcomes after specific medical interventions.  
Researchers can identify and rank genes related to clinical survival outcomes based on gene expression where these clinical survival outcomes include overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). This enables the discovery of potential biomarkers that show how patients will respond to existing treatments or help in the advancement of novel therapeutic strategies (3).

**Single-cell transcriptomics in cancer**   
Moreover, by looking at the single-cell level, researchers can identify intra-tumor heterogeneity, which is crucial in understanding cancer heterogeneity. However, drug sensitivity and response are affected by the co-existence of subpopulations in the same cancer type (4)  
   
**Conclusion**   
Transcriptomics analysis is a powerful technology in all its applications, especially when looking at cancer biology. Potential biomarkers related to cancer can be discovered by examining the full spectrum of RNA transcripts, which could be crucial in early cancer detection, diagnosis and prediction of potential treatment strategies. Transcriptomics when combined with clinical data can give insights into existing treatments or advance toward a new one. Furthermore, researchers can understand drug sensitivity by technologies like single-cell transcriptomics to discover intra-tumor heterogeneity.
